## Supervised Learning Projects
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function to infer a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. 

An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way.

This repo contains my personal supervised learning machine learning projects.
